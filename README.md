Weather App
===========

Overview
--------

The Weather App is a responsive web application built using modern web technologies. It provides users with real-time weather information, including temperature, precipitation, and other weather-related data. The app is designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing, leveraging various libraries and frameworks to enhance the user experience.

APIs Used
-----------------
-   **Open Weather API**: https://openweathermap.org/api
-   **Geo Location API**: https://getgeoapi.com/


Technologies Used
-----------------

### Frontend

-   **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
-   **Vite**: A build tool that provides a fast development environment.
-   **Styled-Components**: A library for styling React components using tagged template literals.
-   **Ant Design (AntD)**: A comprehensive UI component library for React.
-   **Zustand**: A small, fast, and scalable state management solution.
-   **React Hook Form / Zod**: A library for managing form state and validation.
-   **React Query**: A library for fetching, caching, and updating asynchronous data in React.
-   **ECharts**: A powerful charting and visualization library.

### Testing

-   **Jest**: A delightful JavaScript testing framework.
-   **React Testing Library**: A library for testing React components.
-   **@testing-library/jest-dom**: Custom jest matchers to test the state of the DOM.

### Build and Development Tools

-   **Babel**: A JavaScript compiler.
-   **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript code.
-   **Prettier**: An opinionated code formatter.
-   **Vite**: A build tool that provides a fast development environment.

Features
--------

-   **Real-time Weather Data**: Fetches and displays current weather data for a specified city.
-   **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
-   **Interactive Charts**: Visualizes weather data using interactive charts.
-   **Theming**: Supports theming using styled-components and context API.
-   **Form Validation**: Utilizes React Hook Form for managing form state and validation.

Responsiveness
--------------

The app is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes. This is achieved using:

-   **CSS Flexbox and Grid**: For flexible and adaptive layouts.
-   **Media Queries**: To apply different styles based on screen size.
-   **Styled-Components**: For dynamic styling based on props and screen size.

Performance
-----------

Performance is a key consideration in the development of this app. The following techniques are used to ensure optimal performance:

-   **Code Splitting**: Using dynamic imports to load components only when needed.
-   **Lazy Loading**: Deferring the loading of non-critical resources.
-   **Caching**: Utilizing React Query for efficient data fetching and caching.
-   **Optimized Builds**: Using Vite for fast builds and optimized production bundles.

Areas for Improvement
---------------------

### Testing

-   **Increase Test Coverage**: Add more unit and integration tests to cover all components and functionalities.
-   **End-to-End Testing**: Implement end-to-end tests using tools like Cypress to ensure the app works as expected in a real-world scenario.
-    **JEST -> RTL**: migrate from JEST to react-testing-library

### UI Enhancements

-   **More Use of AntD**: Leverage more components from Ant Design to enhance the UI and provide a consistent look and feel.
-   **Custom Themes**: Implement custom themes to allow users to switch between different visual styles.

### Advanced Features

-   **Use of LLMs (Large Language Models)**: Integrate AI-powered features such as natural language processing for weather queries and predictions.
-   **Advanced Analytics**: Provide more detailed weather analytics and visualizations using advanced charting libraries.
